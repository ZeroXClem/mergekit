# mergekit

## Overview

`mergekit` is a toolkit for merging pre-trained language models. It uses an out-of-core approach to perform complex merges in resource-constrained situations. Merges can be run entirely on CPU or accelerated with as little as 8 GB of VRAM.

## Features

- Supports Llama, Mistral, GPT-NeoX, StableLM, and more
- Multiple merge methods
- GPU or CPU execution
- Lazy loading of tensors for low memory use
- Interpolated gradients for parameter values
- Piecewise assembly of language models from layers ("Frankenmerging")
- Mixture of Experts merging
- LORA extraction
- Evolutionary merge methods

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit.git
cd mergekit
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The main script is `mergekit-yaml`:

```sh
mergekit-yaml path/to/your/config.yml ./output-model-directory [options]
```

## Merge Configuration

Merge configurations are specified in YAML format. Key elements include:

- `merge_method`
- `slices` or `models`
- `base_model`
- `parameters`
- `dtype`
- `tokenizer_source`

## Merge Methods

Supported merge methods include:

1. Linear
2. SLERP
3. Task Arithmetic
4. TIES
5. DARE TIES
6. DARE Linear
7. Passthrough
8. Model Breadcrumbs
9. Model Breadcrumbs + TIES
10. Model Stock
11. DELLA
12. DELLA Linear

## Additional Features

- LoRA extraction
- Mixture of Experts merging
- Evolutionary merge methods

## Cloud Merging

Merging can be performed in the cloud using Arcee's cloud GPUs.

This markdown version provides a structured overview of the `mergekit` toolkit, its features, installation process, usage instructions, configuration details, supported merge methods, and additional functionalities.
(base) ➜  mergekit git:(main) aichat --file README.md Explain how to use mergekit
Here's an explanation of how to use mergekit based on the provided README:

1. Installation:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit.git`
   - Navigate to the directory: `cd mergekit`
   - Install the package: `pip install -e .`

2. Basic Usage:
   - Use the `mergekit-yaml` script as the main entry point
   - Command structure:
     ```
     mergekit-yaml path/to/your/config.yml ./output-model-directory [options]
     ```
   - Options include `--cuda`, `--lazy-unpickle`, `--allow-crimes`, etc.

3. Configuration:
   - Create a YAML configuration file specifying the merge operations
   - Key elements in the config file:
     - `merge_method`: Specifies the merging algorithm
     - `slices` or `models`: Define which parts of models to use
     - `base_model`: Specifies the base model for some methods
     - `parameters`: Set various parameters for the merge
     - `dtype`: Specifies the data type for the operation
     - `tokenizer_source`: Determines how to construct the output tokenizer

4. Merge Methods:
   - Various methods are available like Linear, SLERP, Task Arithmetic, TIES, DARE, etc.
   - Each method has its own parameters and use cases

5. Additional Features:
   - LoRA extraction: Use `mergekit-extract-lora` script
   - Mixture of Experts merging: Use `mergekit-moe` script
   - Evolutionary merge methods: Detailed in `docs/evolve.md`

6. Cloud Merging:
   - Can be done through the Arcee App or using Python with an API key

7. Uploading to Hugging Face:
   - Edit the generated `README.md` if desired
   - Use `huggingface-cli` to upload the model

Remember to check the examples in the `examples/` directory for sample configurations, and refer to the detailed documentation for specific merge methods and advanced features.
