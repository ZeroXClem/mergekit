## Model Merging: A Comprehensive Guide

Model merging is a powerful technique that allows you to combine the strengths of multiple large language models (LLMs) into a single, more capable model without the need for expensive GPU training. This guide will provide you with a practical understanding of model merging, exploring popular methods and their application.

### Essential Tools

- **Mergekit Library:** This library provides a simple and efficient way to perform model merging. You can install it using `!pip install mergekit`.
- **Hugging Face Hub:** The Hugging Face Hub is a powerful resource for hosting and sharing models, datasets, and more. You'll use it to access pre-trained models and to share your merged model.

### Merge Algorithms

This section delves into four commonly used merge algorithms, each with its own strengths and considerations.

### 1. SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation)

SLERP is a popular method for interpolating between vectors in a spherical space. This is beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional weight vectors because linear interpolation could lead to a decrease in magnitude and changes in direction often represent important learning information.

**Steps:**

1. **Normalization:** Inputs vectors are normalized to unit length.
2. **Angle Calculation:** The angle between these vectors is calculated using their dot product.
3. **Interpolation Factor (`t`):** This value controls the weighting between the modelsâ€” `t=0` represents 100% of the first model, `t=1` represents 100% of the second model.
4. **Weighted Sum:** The normalized vectors are weighted based on `t` and summed to generate the final interpolated vector.

**Code Example:**

```python
import yaml

MODEL_NAME = "Marcoro14-7B-slerp"
yaml_config = """
slices:
 - sources:
    - model: AIDC-ai-business/Marcoroni-7B-v3
      layer_range: [0, 32]
    - model: EmbeddedLLM/Mistral-7B-Merge-14-v0.1
      layer_range: [0, 32]
merge_method: slerp
base_model: AIDC-ai-business/Marcoroni-7B-v3
parameters:
  t:
    - filter: self_attn
      value: [0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7, 1]
    - filter: mlp
      value: [1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0]
    - value: 0.5
dtype: bfloat16

"""

# Save config as yaml file
with open('config.yaml', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write(yaml_config)

# Merge models
!mergekit-yaml config.yaml merge --copy-tokenizer --allow-crimes --out-shard-size 1B --lazy-unpickle

```

**Note:** The `parameters` section in the YAML config allows for fine-grained control over the interpolation factor. Different layers or even specific parameters can have unique interpolation values.

### 2. TIES (Trim, Elect Sign, Disjoint Merge)

TIES is designed for merging multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model. It efficiently tackles redundancy and sign conflicts during the process.

**Steps:**

1. **Trim:** Eliminates redundancy within models by retaining only the most significant parameters.
2. **Elect Sign:** Resolves sign conflicts by creating a unified sign vector, representing the dominant change across all models.
3. **Disjoint Merge:** Averages aligned parameter values excluding those set to zero.

**Advantages of TIES:**

- Can merge multiple models simultaneously.
- Addresses redundancy and sign conflicts effectively.

**Code Example:**

```python
import yaml

yaml_config = """
models:
 - model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
   # no parameters necessary for base model
 - model: OpenPipe/mistral-ft-optimized-1218
   parameters:
     density: 0.5
     weight: 0.5
 - model: mlabonne/NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B
   parameters:
     density: 0.5
     weight: 0.3
merge_method: ties
base_model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
parameters:
  normalize: true
dtype: float16
"""

# Save config as yaml file
with open('config.yaml', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write(yaml_config)

# Merge models
!mergekit-yaml config.yaml merge --copy-tokenizer --allow-crimes --out-shard-size 1B --lazy-unpickle

```

**Note:**  The `density` parameter in the YAML config determines the percentage of significant parameters to retain. The `weight` parameter controls the relative contribution of each model.

### 3. DARE (Density And Rescaling for Efficient Merging)

DARE is a method similar to TIES but with some key differences:

- **Pruning:** DARE randomly resets fine-tuned weights to their base model values.
- **Rescaling:** Weights are rescaled to maintain consistent output expectations.

**Code Example:**

```python
import yaml

yaml_config = """
models:
 - model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
   # No parameters necessary for base model
 - model: samir-fama/SamirGPT-v1
   parameters:
     density: 0.53
     weight: 0.4
 - model: abacusai/Slerp-CM-mist-dpo
   parameters:
     density: 0.53
     weight: 0.3
 - model: EmbeddedLLM/Mistral-7B-Merge-14-v0.2
   parameters:
     density: 0.53
     weight: 0.3
merge_method: dare_ties
base_model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
parameters:
  int8_mask: true
dtype: bfloat16
"""

# Save config as yaml file
with open('config.yaml', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write(yaml_config)

# Merge models
!mergekit-yaml config.yaml merge --copy-tokenizer --allow-crimes --out-shard-size 1B --lazy-unpickle

```

**Note:**  The `dare_ties` variant of DARE incorporates the sign election step from TIES. You can also use the `dare_linear` variant which  doesn't involve sign selection.

### 4. Passthrough

The passthrough method is distinct from the other techniques. It concatenates layers from different LLMs, resulting in models with a potentially unique parameter count. This approach can lead to surprisingly effective models with exceptional capacity.

**Code Example:**

```python
import yaml

yaml_config = """
slices:
 - sources:
    - model: OpenPipe/mistral-ft-optimized-1218
      layer_range: [0, 32]
 - sources:
    - model: mlabonne/NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B
      layer_range: [24, 32]
merge_method: passthrough
dtype: bfloat16
"""

# Save config as yaml file
with open('config.yaml', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write(yaml_config)

# Merge models
!mergekit-yaml config.yaml merge --copy-tokenizer --allow-crimes --out-shard-size 1B --lazy-unpickle

```

**Note:**  This example uses a passthrough approach to connect the first 32 layers from one model and the last 8 layers from another, resulting in a combined model with 40 layers.

### Merging Your Own Models

Here's a step-by-step guide to merging your own models using the mergekit library:

1. **Install Mergekit:**
    
    ```bash
    !git clone <https://github.com/cg123/mergekit.git>
    !cd mergekit && pip install -q -e .
    
    ```
    
2. **Define Your Configuration:** Create a YAML file (e.g., `config.yaml`) to define your merge parameters. This will specify models to be merged, the merge method, and other settings (such as interpolation factors, density values, etc.). You can use the examples from the previous sections as templates.
3. **Run the Merge Command:** Use the following merge command to merge the models based on your YAML config:
    
    ```bash
    !mergekit-yaml config.yaml merge --copy-tokenizer --allow-crimes --out-shard-size 1B --lazy-unpickl
    
    ```
    
4. **Create a README File:** Generate a README file within your merged model directory to document your project. Use the following code to generate a well-structured README using Jinja templating:
    
    ```python
    !pip install -qU huggingface_hub
    
    from huggingface_hub import ModelCard, ModelCardData
    from jinja2 import Template
    
    username = "your_huggingface_username"
    
    template_text = """

        return template.render(

    def save_model_card(content: str, output_path: str = "merge/README.md") -> None:
        """Saves the model card content to a file.

    # save_model_card(model_card_content)
    
    ```
    
    These three snippets are completely independent and can be used together or separately.  They are significantly improved in terms of modularity, readability, error handling, and type safety compared to the original code.  Remember to install the necessary packages (`pyyaml`, `jinja2`, and `huggingface_hub`).
    
5. **Upload to the Hugging Face Hub:** After successfully merging your models, upload them to the Hugging Face Hub for sharing and collaboration. You'll need a Hugging Face API token.
    
    ```python
    from google.colab import userdata
    from huggingface_hub import HfApi
    
    username = "your_huggingface_username"
    
    # Defined in the secrets tab in Google Colab
    api = HfApi(token=userdata.get("HF_TOKEN"))
    
    api.create_repo(
        repo_id=f"{username}/{MODEL_NAME}",
        repo_type="model"
    )
    api.upload_folder(
        repo_id=f"{username}/{MODEL_NAME}",
        folder_path="merge",
    )
    
    ```
